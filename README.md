There are several related designs here including SVG files for cutting the coil formers and supports and
Kicad files for the pulse controller and signal amplipher. 

There are some KiCad symbols and footprints in other respositories https://github.com/dqmcdonald/DQM_kicad_new.pretty and https://github.com/dqmcdonald/DQM_kicad
