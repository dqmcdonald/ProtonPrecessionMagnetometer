Design files for a Proton Precession Magnetometer

Based on "Signals from the Subatomic World" by Stefan and Richard Hollos
https://books.google.co.nz/books/about/Signals_from_the_Subatomic_World_How_to.html


There are several related designs here including SVG files for cutting the coil formers and supports and
Kicad files for the pulse controller and signal amplipher. 

Hardware:

	PPM Amplifier v1.0 - initial failed design for signal amplifier

	PPM Amplifier v2.0 

  	PPM Mosfet Bank - PCB for coil switching mosfets

	Pulse Controller - Arduino based controller and ADC for data collection

	Various design files for polarising and sensor coil formers. 

Software:

	PPMPulseControllerADC - Arduino sketch for pulse control and signal 
				collection

	RPiPythonCode - Python scripts to run on the Raspberry Pi - overall
			control and final analysis.



There are some KiCad symbols and footprints in other respositories https://github.com/dqmcdonald/DQM_kicad_new.pretty and https://github.com/dqmcdonald/DQM_kicad
